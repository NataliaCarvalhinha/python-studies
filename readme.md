# Python Studies

This repository contains my Python study projects and exercises.

## Description

This repository serves as a compilation of Python projects I've created while studying the language. It encompasses a variety of projects spanning different domains. The projects within this repository are designed to showcase my progress and proficiency in Python as I continue to explore and deepen my understanding of its capabilities.

## Projects

- 2048: Popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Players move tiles in four directions—up, down, left, and right—combining tiles with the same number. With each move, a new tile randomly appears on the board. The game ends when the board fills up, and no more moves can be made.

- Anagram: Word puzzle game where players rearrange letters of a word or phrase to form new words. The goal is to use all the given letters to create valid words. Players can rearrange the letters as many times as they want within a time limit or a set number of moves. The difficulty can vary depending on the length and complexity of the words. Anagram tests players' vocabulary, spelling, and ability to think quickly.

- Algorithms and Data Structures: Implementations of essential algorithms and data structures. It aims to provide practical examples and insights into problem-solving techniques commonly used in computer science.
